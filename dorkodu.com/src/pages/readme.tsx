        And then, once a connection had been established, you suddenly had access to a completely new world. A world of

      <Text>It was mind blowing.A magical moment.</Text>
      <Text>
        Everyone of us has experienced their own transformative moments with computers. The first time you touched a
        touchscreen. The first time you wrote and executed a line of code. The first time you discovered a video game
        that completely consumed you.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        It’s often difficult to describe these moments because, like magic, they lie beyond articulation. They have to
        be experienced.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Computers are not magic in themselves. It’s the software that runs on them, the interaction between bits and
        atoms, that makes them magical.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        One ingredient of computer magic is software’s ability to create even more magical experiences. It’s a tool for
        tools. Great software supports human intellect. But magical software enhances human creativity.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The early pioneers of modern computing described computers as “dream machines”. What got them excited about
        computers was not so much what they were, but everything they had the potential to be.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        This is the other facet of software magic: It stretches our imagination beyond what we thought was possible.
        Great software makes us feel like we live in the future. But magical software allows us to imagine the future
        that comes after it.
